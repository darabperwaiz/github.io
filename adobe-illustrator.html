                        <p>Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design program developed and marketed by
                            Adobe Inc. Originally designed for the Apple Macintosh, development of Adobe Illustrator
                            began in 1985. Along with Creative Cloud (Adobe's shift to monthly or annual subscription
                            service delivered over the Internet), Illustrator CC was released. The latest version,
                            Illustrator 2022, was released on October 26, 2021, and is the 25th generation in the
                            product line. Adobe Illustrator was reviewed as the best vector graphics editing program in
                            2018 by PC Magazine.

                            Development of Adobe Illustrator for the Apple Macintosh began in 1985[2] (shipping in
                            January 1987) as a commercialization of Adobe's in-house font development software and
                            PostScript file format. Adobe Illustrator is the companion product of Adobe Photoshop.
                            Photoshop is primarily geared toward digital photo manipulation and photorealistic styles of
                            computer illustration, while Illustrator provides results in the typesetting and logo
                            graphic areas of design. Early magazine advertisements (featured in graphic design trade
                            magazines such as Communication Arts) referred to the product as "the Adobe Illustrator".
                            Illustrator 88, the product name for version 1.7,[3] was released in 1988 and introduced
                            many new tools and features.[4]

                            Byte in 1989 listed Illustrator 88 as among the "Distinction" winners of the Byte Awards,
                            stating that with it Adobe had "pulled ahead" of previously industry-dominant competitor
                            Aldus FreeHand.[5]

                            Early versions of the software did not support working in preview mode and users needed to
                            have two windows open on their desktop in order to have a live preview of their work. One
                            window would show the work in progress and the other window would show a preview of the work
                            in progress.

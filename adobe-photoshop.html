                        <p>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows
                            and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the
                            software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in
                            digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to
                            its usage as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest")
                            although Adobe discourages such use.[5] Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in
                            multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models including
                            RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats
                            to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities
                            to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the
                            latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins;
                            programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer
                            new or enhanced features.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            Photoshop's naming scheme was initially based on version numbers. However, in October 2002
                            (following the introduction of Creative Suite branding), each new version of Photoshop was
                            designated with "CS" plus a number; e.g., the eighth major version of Photoshop was Photoshop CS
                            and the ninth was Photoshop CS2. Photoshop CS3 through CS6 were also distributed in two
                            different editions: Standard and Extended. With the introduction of the Creative Cloud branding
                            in June 2013 (and in turn, the change of the "CS" suffix to "CC"), Photoshop's licensing scheme
                            was changed to that of software as a service subscription model. Historically, Photoshop was
                            bundled with additional software such as Adobe ImageReady, Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Bridge, Adobe
                            Device Central and Adobe Camera RAW.

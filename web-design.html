                        <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually
                            refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software
                            development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers;
                            however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become
                            ever-increasingly important.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website.
                            Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how
                            information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically
                            pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with
                            a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might
                            distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designerâ€™s output is a site that
                            wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user
                            frustration as possible is a critical consideration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and
                            mobile are responsive and adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically
                            depending on screen size; in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes
                            that match common screen sizes. Preserving a layout that is as consistent as possible
                            between devices is crucial to maintaining user trust and engagement. As responsive design
                            can present difficulties in this regard, designers must be careful in relinquishing control
                            of how their work will appear. If they are responsible for the content as well, while they
                            may need to broaden their skillset, they will enjoy having the advantage of full control of
                            the finished product.

                        <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[9]
                            Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion,
                            snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard
                            shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

                            Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build
                            conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter.[10]

                            On November 18, 2015, the source of Visual Studio Code was released under the MIT License,
                            and made available on GitHub. Extension support was also announced.[11] On April 14, 2016,
                            Visual Studio Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the Web.[12]
                            Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source code on GitHub under the
                            permissive MIT License,[5][13] while the releases by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.[7]

                            In the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular
                            developer environment tool, with 70% of 82,000 respondents reporting that they use it.[14]
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming
                            languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python and C++.[15][16][17][18] It is
                            based on the Electron framework,[19] which is used to develop Node.js Web applications that
                            run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component
                            (codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual
                            Studio Team Services).[20]

                            Instead of a project system, it allows users to open one or more directories, which can then
                            be saved in workspaces for future reuse. This allows it to operate as a language-agnostic
                            code editor for any language. It supports a number of programming languages and a set of
                            features that differs per language. Unwanted files and folders can be excluded from the
                            project tree via the settings. Many Visual Studio Code features are not exposed through
                            menus or the user interface but can be accessed via the command palette.[21]

                            Visual Studio Code can be extended via extensions,[22] available through a central
                            repository. This includes additions to the editor[23] and language support.[21] A notable
                            feature is the ability to create extensions that add support for new languages, themes, and
                            debuggers, perform static code analysis, and add code linters using the Language Server
                            Protocol.[24]

                            Visual Studio Code includes multiple extensions for FTP, allowing the software to be used as
                            a free alternative for web development. Code can be synced between the editor and the
                            server, without downloading any extra software.

                            Visual Studio Code allows users to set the code page in which the active document is saved,
                            the newline character, and the programming language of the active document. This allows it
                            to be used on any platform, in any locale, and for any given programming language.
